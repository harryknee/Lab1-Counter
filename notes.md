## Summary of Workflow
- We write in hardware description language(HDL) called **System Verilog**
- We then simulate the HDL we wrote using **Verilator** by giving it a testbench script in C++
    - Verilator translates Verilog into C++
    - Verilator takes in both `.sv` and `.cpp` to generate a **make file
- We then build the C++ project, via the make file generated by Verilator. This gives us an **executable simulation file**
- Run the executable simulation file to see the waveform
